[Graduation Dissertation]: Air Quality Forecast System

## Air Quality Prediction System

This repository contains the full implementation of my graduation dissertation project, Air Quality Prediction System. The system is designed to predict air quality levels by analyzing historical and real-time data, providing actionable insights to help mitigate pollution impacts.

## Overview

The project aims to enhance the accuracy and responsiveness of air quality predictions using [mention relevant technologies, e.g., “machine learning, geospatial analysis, or time series forecasting”]. It is built with [mention any specific frameworks or libraries, like “Go, ReactJS, Docker, SQL”] to efficiently process large datasets and deliver predictions in near-real-time.

## Key Features
    •	Accurate air quality predictions using advanced models
    •	Real-time data processing and visualization
    •	Scalable architecture with [mention any relevant scaling tech, like “containerized Docker deployment”]

## Setup and Installation
1. Install Node Packages
  `npm run install`
2. Run Client
 `cd client && npm run build && npm run start`
3. Run Server
 `cd server && npm run build && npm run start`
